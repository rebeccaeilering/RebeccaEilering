        <h3>Let me introduce myself.</h3>
        <p>I haven't won any design or web developer awards but I still work hard and learn something new everyday. I'm a 40(ish) year old Associate Web Developer for LRS WebSolutions. I'm from the St. Louis region but just recently moved to Springfiled, IL.</p>
        <p>Before the web development life called, I spent many late night in a printmaking studio making etchings at Southern Illinois University (BFA). Then I took my printmaking obsession to graduate school at Ohio University (MFA). While living in Athens, OH, I made more prints and did a lot of drawing, painting and other fun creative things. While in school I traveled to the UK and to many places around the US.</p>
        <p>Upon graduation I moved back to the St. Louis area and worked various gigs teaching art. I taught workshops at Center for Creative Arts and classes at St. Charles Community College. While teaching I made art in a basement studio and participated in exhibitions in St. Louis and in the midwest.</p>
        <p>Aside from art, I've had interest in the web. During my freshman year in college (1996 -97) I made a website on geocities that included a primitive blog (all hard coded!) and took a computer class or two. I took some graphic design courses too because that was what I was going to major in. That got sent to the backburner as I got sucked into the fine art classes. Fast forward nearly 10 years, after my thesis exhibition was over I had a month of downtime before graduating, I made a website for her art.</p>
        <p>Over the years I did several projects on the side making websites for extra money. As I made progress upping my skills I took a job with updating the websites of the Auffenberg Dealer Group in O'Fallon, IL. Then less than a year later tI ook a job as a web designer for BluSolutions. While at BluSolutions I designed websites and other marketing materials for car dealers. Plus, I helped develop the front end on websites and maintained their sites day-to-day.</p>
        <p>Over time I became less interested in making designs and more interested in the construction of the sites. I spent more time learning web development and less time with design and art. Then in late 2017, I took a job at LRS Web Solutions and that is where I am today.</p>
        <p>For fun I likes to read (books, comics, graphic novels), watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, go for walks (playing Pokemon Go), go on bike rides (bikes to work too), travel, go thrifting and antiquing, and I like play with my tuxedo cat named, Map.</p>
