      <p>I'm a web developer for LRS WebSolutions. I'm from the St. Louis region but moved to Springfiled,
        IL a couple years ago.</p>
      <p>Before becoming a web developer, I spent many late
        nights in a printmaking studio making etchings or in a studio making drawings at Southern Illinois University
        (BFA). Then I took my art obsession to graduate school at Ohio University (MFA). While living in Athens, OH, I
        made more prints and did a lot of drawings, paintings and other fun creative things. While in school I traveled
        to the UK and to many places around the US.</p>
      <p><img class="self" src="/images/rebecca-web.jpg" alt="">Upon graduation I moved back to the St. Louis area and worked various gigs teaching art. I taught workshops
        at Center for Creative Arts and classes at St. Charles Community College. While teaching I made art in a
        basement studio and participated in exhibitions in St. Louis and in the midwest.</p>
      <p>Aside from art, I've had interest in the web. During my freshman year in college (1996 -97) I made a website
        on Geocities that included a primitive blog (all hard coded!) and took a computer class or two. I took some
        graphic design courses because that was what I was going to major in. That got sent to the backburner as I got
        sucked into the fine art classes. Fast forward nearly 10 years, after my thesis exhibition was over, I had a
        month of downtime before graduating. I decided to make a website for my art.</p>
      <p>Over the years I did several projects on the side making websites for extra money. As I made progress upping
        my skills, I took a job with updating the websites for the Auffenberg Dealer Group in O'Fallon, IL. Less than
        a year later I took a job as a web designer for BluSolutions. While at BluSolutions, I designed websites and
        other marketing materials for car dealers. Plus, I helped develop the front-end and with day-to-day
        maintenance of the sites.</p>
      <p>Over time I became less interested in making designs and more interested in the construction of the sites. I
        spent more time learning web development and less time with design and art. Then in the Fall of 2017, I took a job at
        LRS Web Solutions and that is where I am today.</p>
      <p>For fun I likes reading (books, comics, graphic novels), watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts and
        music, going for walks and hiking, going on bike rides, traveling, thrifting and antiquing. Finally, I
        like playing with my tuxedo cat, Map.</p>

          <h2>What I'm Reading</h2>
          <p>I like to read. I made it a goal, starting last September, to try to read every day. Why not? During a global pandemic there isn't too much to do!</p>
          <p>I'm currently reading <strong>The Andromeda Strain</strong> by Michael Crichton.</p>
