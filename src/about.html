        <h3>Let me introduce myself.</h3>
        <p>Rebecca hasn't won any design or web developer awards but she works hard and learns something new everyday. She is a 40(ish) year old Associate Web Developer for LRS WebSolutions. She is from the St. Louis region but just recently moved to Springfiled, IL.</p>
        <p>Before the web development life called, she spent many late night in a printmaking studio making etchings at Southern Illinois University (BFA). Then she took her printmaking obsession to graduate school at Ohio University (MFA). While living in Athens, OH, she made more prints and did a lot of drawing, painting and other fun creative things. While in school she traveled to the UK and to many places around the US.</p>
        <p>Upon graduation she moved back to the St. Louis area and worked various gigs teaching art. She taught workshops at Center for Creative Arts and classes at St. Charles Community College. While teaching she made art in a basement studio and participated in exhibitions in St. Louis and in the midwest US.</p>
        <p>Aside from art, Rebecca has had interest in the web. During her freshman year in college (1996 -97) she made a website on geocities that included a primitive blog(!) and took a computer class or two. Rebecca took some graphic design courses too. That got sent to the backburner as she got sucked into the art classes. Fast forward nearly 10 years, after her thesis exhibition was over and had a month of downtime before graduating, she made a website for her art.</p>
        <p>Over the years she did several projects on the side making websites for extra money. As she made progress with her skills she took a job with updating the websites of the Auffenberg Dealer Group in O'Fallon, IL. Then a year later took a job as a web designer for BluSolutions. While at BluSolutions she designed websites and other marketing materials for car dealers. Plus, she helped develop websites and maintained their sites day-to-day.</p>
        <p>Over time she because less interested in making designs and more interested in the construction of the sites. She spent more time learning web development and less time with design and art. Then in late 2017, she took a job at LRS Web Solutions and that is where she is today.</p>
        <p>For fun she likes to read (books, comics, graphic novels), watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, go for walks (playing Pokemon Go), go on bike rides (bikes to work too), travel, go thrifting and antiquing, and play with her tuxedo cat named, Map.</p>
