        <h3>Who is this woman?</h3>
        <p>Rebecca hasn't won any design or web developer awards but she works hard is learning everyday. She is a 40 year old Associate Web Developer for LRS WebSolutions. She lives and (mostly) works in the St. Louis metro area.</p>
        <p>Before the web development life called, she spent many late night in a printmaking studio making etchings at Southern Illinois University (BFA). Then she took her printmaking obsession to graduate school at Ohio University (MFA). While living in Athens, OH, she made more prints and did a lot of drawing, painting and other fun creative things. While in school she traveled to the UK and to many places around the US.</p>
        <p>Upon graduation she moved back to the St. Louis area and worked various gigs teaching art. She taught workshops at Center for Creative Arts and classes at St. Charles Community College. While teaching she made art in her basement studio and participated in exhibitions in St. Louis and in the midwest. I pursued this life until I was about 34-35.</p>
        <p>Aside from art Rebecca has had interest in the web. During her freshman year in college she made a website on geocities and took a computer class or two, and she took some graphic design courses. That got sent to the backburner as she got sucked into the art classes. Fast forward nearly 10 years, as she left acadamia she made a website for her art. Plus did several projects on the side making websites. As she made progress with her skills she took a job with updating the websites of the Auffenberg Dealer Group and then a year later took a job as a web designer for BluSolutions. While at BluSolutions she designed websites and other marketing materials for car dealers, and helped code and update their sites.</p>
        <p>Over time she because less interested in making designs and more interested in the construction of the sites. She spent more time learning web development and less time with design and art. Then in late 2017, she took a job at LRS Web Solutions and that is where she is today.</p>
        <p>For fun she likes to read, watch YouTube, go for walks and bike rides, travel, go thrifting and antiquing, and play with her tuxedo cat named, Map.</p>
