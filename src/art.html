                    <h3>The Artist</h3>
                    <p>Throughout her childhood, Rebecca had a knack for drawing. It was something she loved to do. When it came time to decide on what she wanted to do for a living she was going to go into commercial art or graphic design. However once in school she fell in love with the non-commercial side of art and went full throttle into drawing, painting and printmaking. Rebecca ended up going to graduate school and wanted to teach art and make art for a living.</p>
                    <p>Truth be told, it's really really really hard to have an art career. All in all, she did do those things. She taught art. She made art. She sold art. However while making art there were other things to do like make a website for her art (amongst other things) and over time she got more into that than having an art career.</p>
                    <p>As she transitioned more into web design and development she decided it was more fun to just make art as a hobby. She didn't really enjoy many aspects of the art world.</p>
                    <p>So now Rebecca just makes art on occasion but it has been a big part in her life. The path to being an artist hasn't ended, it's just taking a detour.</p>
