                    <h3>The Artist</h3>
                    <p>Throughout my childhood, I had a knack for drawing. It was something I loved to do all the time. When it came time to decide on what I wanted to do for a living, I decided I was going to go into commercial art or graphic design. However, once in school I fell in love with the non-commercial side of art and went full throttle into drawing, painting and printmaking. I ended up going to graduate school to get my MFA and wanted to teach art and make art for a living.</p>
                    <p>Truth be told, it's really really really hard to have an art career. All in all, I did do those things. I taught art. I made art. I sold art. However, while making art there were other things to do like make a website for my art (amongst other things) and over time I got more into that than having an art career.</p>
                    <p>As I transitioned more into web design and development I decided it was more fun to just make art as a hobby. I didn't really enjoy many aspects of the art world.</p>
                    <p>So now I just makes art for fun but it has been a big part in her life. I make things I think are fun.</p>
