I'm from the St. Louis region but moved to Springfiled, IL a couple years ago.</p><p>Before becoming a web developer, I spent many late nights in a printmaking studio making etchings or in a studio making drawings at Southern Illinois University (BFA). Then I took my art obsession to graduate school at Ohio University (MFA). While living in Athens, OH, I made more prints and did a lot of drawings, paintings and other fun creative things. While in school I traveled to the UK and to many places around the US.</p><p><img class="self" src="/images/rebecca-web.jpg" alt="">Upon graduation I moved back to the St. Louis area and worked various gigs teaching art. I taught workshops at Center for Creative Arts and classes at St. Charles Community College. While teaching I made art in a basement studio and participated in exhibitions in St. Louis and in the midwest.</p><p>Aside from art, I've had interest in the web. During my freshman year in college (1996 -97) I made a website on Geocities that included a primitive blog (all hard coded!) and took a computer class or two. I took some graphic design courses because that was what I was going to major in. That got sent to the backburner as I got sucked into the fine art classes. Fast forward nearly 10 years, after my thesis exhibition was over, I had a month of downtime before graduating. I decided to make a website for my art.</p><p>Over the years I did several projects on the side making websites for extra money. As I made progress upping my skills, I took a job with updating the websites for the Auffenberg Dealer Group in O'Fallon, IL. Less than a year later I took a job as a web designer for BluSolutions. While at BluSolutions, I designed websites and other marketing materials for car dealers. Plus, I helped develop the front-end and with day-to-day maintenance of the sites.</p><p>Over time I became less interested in making designs and more interested in the construction of the sites. I spent more time learning web development and less time with design and art. Then in the Fall of 2017, I took a job at LRS Web Solutions and that is where I am today.</p><p>For fun I likes reading (books, comics, graphic novels), watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts and music, going for walks and hiking, going on bike rides, traveling, thrifting and antiquing. Finally, I like playing with my tuxedo cat, Map.</p><article class="facts"><header><h2>Ten fun facts about myself</h2></header><ul><li><p>My favorite dessert is ice cream (or frozen custard from Bobby's in Maryville, IL)</p></li><li><p>I like putting together LEGO Architecture series sets.
